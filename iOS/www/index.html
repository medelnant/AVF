                        <h2>Week 2</h2>
                        <h5>
                            Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could Twitter be used in these two scenarios?
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Utilizing Twitter for login/payments can help convey a seamless process by leveraging existing data. An example would be to consider “Login with Twitter” which if used correctly, can replicate existing data from the service to store for our own records. This eliminates the redundancy of having to enter information more than once. We can also personalize the experience by incorporating some of the media and maybe pulling back associated testimonial tweets that are relevant to the service that they are signing up for.  Lastly, as stated in other posts, the same information can be repurposed for payment details. At that point, the user would just have provided their payment method of choice.
                        </p>
                        <h5>
                            Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically? 
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            To have the ability to send data over multiple domains or also referred to as cross-domain.  Scripts tags have the ability to bypass the cross-domain limitations, so essentially json-p is wrapping an object response in the form of a callback of function.
                        </p>
                        <h5>
                            Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native device features?                            
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            I believe that any data-source can somehow be integrated with most native features. Aside from notifications which seem to be an obvious choice, mash-ups with geo-location and usage of Google Maps and a social network have seemed to be a good formula for a successful app. Expanding upon that concept, add a photo service like Instagram and tie in the devices camera to share/post your own photos while browsing photo’s that have been snapped nearby. Nothing new here, but just observing what’s been done in the past.                            
                        </p>
                        <h5>
                            Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.                            
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            After doing a little research on the ESPN API’s, it seems like the only ability I have, as a public user, is to pull headlines and potentially link to stories. Since I’m representing Chicago, my plan is to pull Blackhawk related headlines into my app.                         
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As far as Twitter goes, I plan to stick to the basics. If I focus on the creative or somehow wanting to differentiate too much, I end up losing sight simple requirements         
                        </p>
                        <h5>
                            Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            I’m a firm believer that every project/design needs to start with pen and paper. I usually spend the first day sketching thumbs and writing notes with no rhyme or reason as to how it’s organized. Once, I feel I’m at a good stopping point, I then start to group ideas and move on to higher fidelity sketches.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What tends to burn me the most is when I get caught up with the overall aesthetics of the app. As mentioned earlier, I tend to lose sight of the requirements and end up having to cram the core functionality. At least the app ends up looking good though.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As of late, to avoid getting caught up with the design, I tend to focus on building a bare bones app first. No focus on aesthetics. I create a checklist of all the requirements and manually check them off once I have integrated them into the basic prototype. Once functionality is in place, I then move on to the aesthetics. I still end up distracting myself from time to time and choose to focus on the styles.
